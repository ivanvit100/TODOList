# ❗️ Info for translatros

Here you can observe 2 types of translation files: which stores translations of server messages and which embeds its content directly into the interface.
The application needs the complete structure of both files to work, so create both before you start translating.

File name format: 
* lang.{lang_name}.json
* client.{lang_name}.json

I would like to express a huge thank you to everyone who has contributed or will contribute to the development of the project. 
Translations may have inaccuracies.
